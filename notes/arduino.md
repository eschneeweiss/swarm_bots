* micro USB cable
* know nothing? watch some youtube videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL34zDTPkcs

### Just read instructions
* for my board, https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5.2, or https://www.pololu.com/product/3117/resources

### How to run the demos (on windows)
* Arduino IDE  
download Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* (optional driver)  
install driver, for my board, in https://www.pololu.com/product/3117/resources
* Additional Boards Manager URLs  
open Arduino IDE, in Preferences dialog, find the "Additional Boards Manager URLs", paste `https://files.pololu.com/arduino/package_pololu_index.json`. (This is in instruction)
